# Focused UI Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Successfully transformed the JSON formatter into a focused, editor-first application with all secondary features organized in Settings.

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified Header (SimplifiedHeader.js)
**New Focus**: Editor/Tree view modes as primary actions

**Structure**:
- Left: Brand + File status
- Center: Large **[EDITOR]** and **[TREE]** buttons (primary focus)
- Right: Open, Save, Clear, Search, Settings, Theme

**Visual Design**:
- View buttons: 8px padding, 15px font, green highlight when active
- Secondary buttons: Standard size with icons
- CSS hover animations for smooth interactions

### 2. Enhanced Settings Modal (SettingsModal.js)
**Purpose**: Gateway to all advanced features

**Organized Sections**:
1. **JSON Tools**
   - Format JSON (primary green button)
   - Minify JSON
   - Load Sample JSON

2. **View Options**
   - Compare JSON (side-by-side)

3. **Utilities**
   - Share JSON
   - Keyboard Shortcuts

4. **Editor Settings**
   - Indent Size (2/4/8 spaces)

### 3. Fixed Editor Layout (JsonEditor.js + App.js)
**Problem**: Content showing in small window
**Solution**: 
- Removed fixed height constraints
- Used flex: 1 for full height
- Added border and border-radius for clean look
- Proper overflow handling

## Button Count

| Location | Count | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Header** | 8 buttons | Core workflow |
| **Settings** | 6 actions | Advanced features |
| **Total** | 14 actions | Same as before, better organized |

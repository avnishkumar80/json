# Tree Search & Arrow UX Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Tree View Search Not Working
**Problem**: When searching in tree view, the search wasn't finding results properly because the global search was using text-based search (`searchInJson`) instead of tree-based search (`searchInTree`).

**Solution**:
- Added `onSearchResultsUpdate` callback prop to TreeView component
- TreeView now performs its own tree-specific search using `searchInTree` utility
- When search results are found, TreeView updates the parent component's search state
- This ensures the search counter and navigation work correctly in tree view

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/TreeView/TreeView.js`
  - Added `onSearchResultsUpdate` prop
  - Added useEffect to notify parent when tree search results change
  
- `src/App.js`
  - Added `handleTreeSearchResultsUpdate` callback (wrapped in useCallback)
  - Passed callback to TreeView component
  - Exposed `setSearchResults` and `setCurrentSearchIndex` from useSearch hook

- `src/hooks/useSearch.js`
  - Exported `setSearchResults` and `setCurrentSearchIndex` setters

### 2. Improved Arrow Button UX
**Problem**: The up/down arrow buttons after the search box had poor visual hierarchy and unclear interaction patterns.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced arrow button styling with better padding and sizing
- Changed arrow orientation: ↑ for previous, ↓ for next (more intuitive)
- Improved font size and weight for better visibility
- Applied existing hover effects (header-btn class)
- Enhanced search results counter with background and better typography

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Header/SimplifiedHeader.js`
  - Updated arrow button styles with larger padding (8px 10px)
  - Made arrows larger (fontSize: 16px, fontWeight: 700)
  - Changed previous button to use ↑ instead of rotated ↓
  - Enhanced counter badge with background color and padding
  - Added header-btn class for consistent hover effects

### 3. React Hook Optimization
**Problem**: React Hook warnings about missing dependencies in useEffect.

**Solution**:
- Wrapped `toggleNode`, `expandAll`, and `collapseAll` in useCallback in useTreeView hook
- Used functional state updates to avoid stale closure issues
- Added all required dependencies to useEffect in TreeView
- Wrapped `handleTreeSearchResultsUpdate` in useCallback in App.js

**Files Modified**:
- `src/hooks/useTreeView.js`
  - Converted all functions to use useCallback
  - Used functional setState pattern
  
- `src/App.js`
  - Imported useCallback
  - Wrapped handleTreeSearchResultsUpdate in useCallback
  
- `src/components/TreeView/TreeView.js`
  - Added missing dependencies to useEffect

### 4. Tree Node Scroll Target
**Problem**: Search result scrolling wasn't working because tree nodes didn't have the required data attribute.

**Solution**:
- Added `data-path={path}` attribute to tree node divs
- This allows the scroll-to-result feature to find the correct DOM element

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/TreeView/TreeNode.js`
  - Added data-path attribute to node div

## How It Works Now

### Tree View Search Flow:
1. User types in search box in header
2. Search query is passed to TreeView component
3. TreeView performs tree-specific search using `searchInTree`
4. TreeView calls `onSearchResultsUpdate` with results
5. Parent updates global search state
6. Navigation buttons now work with correct result count
7. Current result is auto-expanded and scrolled into view

### Arrow Button Interaction:
1. Clear visual hierarchy with badge-style counter
2. Large, easy-to-click arrow buttons
3. Intuitive arrow directions (↑ = previous, ↓ = next)
4. Smooth hover effects matching other header buttons
5. Keyboard shortcuts still work (Enter for next, Shift+Enter for previous)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Tree search finds keys and values correctly
- [x] Search counter shows correct result count
- [x] Arrow buttons navigate through results
- [x] Current result is highlighted and scrolled into view
- [x] Parent nodes auto-expand when navigating to results
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts (Enter, Shift+Enter) work
- [x] Arrow buttons have good hover effects
- [x] No React warnings in console
- [x] Build succeeds without errors

## Build Status

✅ Build successful with only minor lint warnings (unused variables)
✅ No runtime errors
✅ File size increase: +23 bytes (negligible)

## Visual Improvements

### Before:
- Small arrow buttons with unclear rotation
- Plain text counter
- No visual feedback on hover
- Confusing arrow direction (rotated down arrow for previous)

### After:
- Large, prominent arrow buttons (↑ and ↓)
- Badge-style counter with background
- Consistent hover effects with other buttons
- Intuitive arrow directions
- Better spacing and padding

## Technical Details

### Search Result Structure (Tree View):
```javascript
{
  path: "root.users.[0].name",  // Full path to the node
  key: "name",                    // The key that matched
  value: "John",                  // The value (if value matched)
  matchType: "key" | "value"      // What type of match
}
```

### Auto-Expansion Logic:
- When navigating to a search result, all parent nodes are automatically expanded
- Uses `getParentPaths()` utility to find all ancestor paths
- Checks if each parent is expanded, and expands if not
- Scrolls smoothly to center the result in the viewport

## Performance Notes

- Tree search is memoized using useMemo
- Only re-searches when query or parsed data changes
- useCallback prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Functional state updates prevent stale closures
- Build size impact is minimal (+23 bytes)

## Next Steps / Future Improvements

1. Consider adding search highlighting in the editor view
2. Add "Clear search" button (X icon) in search input
3. Add search history/recent searches
4. Implement regex search option
5. Add case-sensitive search toggle
6. Consider adding "Replace" functionality
